# Hellicopter
I identify as an Attack Helicopter.
Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on foreign civilians.
People say to me that a person being a helicopter is impossible and I'm being stupid, but I don't care. I am unique!
From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above needlessly.
If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege.
Thank you for being so understanding.
